                    I'm <span style={{color: "#ff521d"}}>Koketjo Sethobja</span>. A Web Developer and Software Developer
                    based in South Africa, Gauteng🌍. I'm a Bachelor of Science graduate🎓
                    in Information Technology💻 from North-West University. I build websites 
                    and other cool tools😎 for other people to use. I love to create cool things.
                    The web is my playground. I love tinkering🛠 with it and making it better.
                    I am curious, hard-working, and passionate about building high quality products.
                    <br /><br />
                    I build websites in React JS, and Node Js (Express). I find React Js and other 
                    as an easy framework to learn and it's fast🌠, it enables you to re-use a code without 
                    writing it again💯. I also build softwares using Java with Springboot. Java is a broad backend
                    language and with Springboot, it can do wonders🧠.
